These are referred to as ‘Doshas’.<\/p><p>At birth, each being is born with a set of characteristics, known as their ‘Prakriti’, which consists of the three Doshas- namely Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas are believed to be responsible for a person’s physiological, mental, and emotional health, and each person’s unique ratio of Vata, Kapha, and Pitta is said to define their Ayurvedic constitution.<\/p><p><strong>The Vata Dosha<br\/><\/strong>Starting with the first Dosha, Vata represents the two elements of air and space (ether) and is generally described as cold, light, dry, rough, flowing, and spacious. Usually described as slim, energetic, and creative, people with an overactive Vata are known for thinking outside the box but can become easily distracted. People with an overactive Vata are likely to be more forgetful, anxious, moody, highly sensitive to the cold, have trouble sleeping, have an irregular appetite and eating patterns, and are more prone to digestive issues and gas, and poor circulation.<\/p><p>An overactive Vata, when identified, can be effectively treated using selected Balance Ayurveda products that help manage issues related to a prominent Vata dosha.<\/p><p><strong>The Pitta Dosha<\/strong><br\/>Based on the element of fire, people with prominent Pitta doshas are known to be highly motivated, goal-oriented, and competitive. But, governed by heat, their aggressive and tenacious nature can lead to conflict. On the plus side, people with a Pitta Dosha have a quick metabolism, good circulation, and healthy skin, and hair, but on the flip side, they are impatient, prone to conflict, prone to acne and inflammation, and sensitive to hot temperatures. <\/p><p>Those with pitta-dominant dosha must focus on work-life balance and avoid extreme heat, along with the right Balance Ayurveda products to manage their health.<\/p><p><strong>The Kapha Dosha<\/strong><br\/>Representing the operations of Water and Earth energy, people with this dosha are described as strong, thick-boned, and caring. They rarely get upset, think before acting, and go through life in a slow, deliberate manner. Although they have a healthy immune system, they are prone to weight gain, slow metabolism, sluggishness, over-sleeping, breathing issues, higher risk of heart disease, and mucus buildup, and depression.<\/p><p>Along with the help of Balance Ayurveda’s Ayurvedic products online, a Kapha-dominant person should focus on regular exercise, a healthy diet, and maintaining a warm body temperature.<\/p><p><strong>Dosha Management<\/strong><br\/>Now that we know what the 3 Doshas stand for, managing dosha imbalance in the body is what we, at Balance Ayurveda help you with. Using naturally-grown, unadulterated ingredients sourced from all over India, we address the symptoms caused by the imbalance in your doshas and aim to uproot them with all the tender love and care of mindfully-concocted Ayurvedic products in order to attain a perfect balance for your mind, body, and soul. <\/p><p><strong>Balance Ayurveda’s Leading Ayurvedic Products<\/strong><br\/>Sourced organically from Mother Earth, Balance Ayurveda’s extensive range of Ayurvedic products online are concocted to provide an answer to numerous medical ailments.

While stressing out may no doubt add to your hair fall, let’s address a few reasons why hair loss happens.<\/p><p><strong>Hairfall Among Women:<\/strong> The number one reason why women may be left hunting for the best hair care products is because of the hair fall that comes with their genes. Hereditary hair loss also called androgenetic alopecia, happens to about 50% of women and can set off at any age. This being said, with the right Ayurvedic products from Balance Ayurveda, this problem can be tackled. Other reasons for hair loss among women include medical conditions, vitamin deficiencies, pregnancy, tight hairstyles, and excessive use of heating tools.<\/p><p><strong>Hairfall Among Men: <\/strong>When it comes to men, genetic factors as well as extreme stress can lead to hair fall and balding. Other reasons may include heavy medical treatment drugs, scalp infections, a poor immune system, and poor or neglected grooming. To combat these issues, Ayurvedic haircare is the only sustainable, organic answer.<\/p><p><strong>How Balance Ayurveda Hair Care Is Made: The Much-Needed TLC For Each Strand!<\/strong><br\/>Working with the Ayurvedic philosophies of the three Doshas: namely Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, we at Balance Ayurveda have created the best hair care products using ancient practices and infusing them with modern techniques. <\/p><p>In Ayurveda, the Pitta Dosha is considered to be the root factor that affects skin and hair health, which is why imbalance can lead to hair loss. This Dosha causes your hair follicles to heat up and is also related to stress-induced hair fall. Balancing the Pitta Dosha and cooling it down with Balance Ayurveda Hair Care, can help tremendously when it comes to hair fall.<\/p><p>At Balance Ayurveda, we maintain a ‘100% clean’ policy on all of our Ayurvedic hair products by making sure our ingredients always remain unadulterated, handpicked, organic, and are only sourced locally from various regions in India. Balance Ayurveda Hair Care includes three of the best hair care products including The Balance Hair Malt, The Balance Hair Capsules, and The Balance Hair Oil- all of which are the only paraben and sulfate-free ayurvedic products online. AYUSH approved.<\/p><p>All of our hair products are GMP-certified, ISO, and HACCP-approved, with no artificial colors, and are entirely environment-friendly. Need we say more??<\/p><p><strong>The Balance Ayurveda Hair Care Range: Put An End To Your Hair Fall Woes<\/strong><br\/>Carefully studying hair growth in Ayurveda, we at balance Ayurveda have concocted a set of three highly effective hair care products that include hair oil, hair malt, and hair capsules. Apart from the many different perks of using Balance Ayurveda that we’ve boasted about, we have also put a lot of thought into each of our Ayurvedic hair care products, and here’s how we’ve ‘heroed’ each!<\/p><p><strong>The Balance Hair Malt<\/strong><br\/>A magical healing potion formulated using organically sourced Ayurvedic ingredients like Bhringraj, Tulsi, Ginseng, Moringa, Mulethi, and more, our Hair Malt tackles hair fall with a potent recipe that nourishes the scalp. Suitable for all ages, genders, and hair types, with continued use for about 3-6 months, our carefully concocted hair malt gives you healthier hair with controlled hair fall and better hair growth. Meant to be taken orally, The Balance Hair Malt can be consumed twice a day by mixing one or two tablespoons with 100-200ml of warm water or milk. <\/p><p><strong>The Balance Hair Capsules<\/strong><br\/>Created to stimulate hair follicles to promote hair growth, our hair capsules are enriched with supplements that provide a hair fall solution like no other. Made using indigenous herbs like amla and Bhringraj, taking these capsules naturally, helps you get rid of scalp dryness and flakiness, thus providing much-needed nourishment and protein to the scalp. Made with essential oils rich in antioxidants and vitamins, the capsules help get rid of fungal and bacterial infections which at times are a cause for immense hair loss, while also nourishing roots and hair follicles by balancing deficient nutrients.<\/p><p>Made with a mixture of 3 classical Ayurvedic medicines including Brahmi Vati, Lakshmi Vilas Ras, and Shir Shuladi Vajra Ras, the Hair capsules from our range of hair care products help combat the root causes of hair fall, hence offering a sustainable solution that doesn’t have any side effects on the body. These hair supplements can be taken in a quantity of one or two, twice a day with lukewarm water or cow milk.<\/p><p><strong>The Balance Hair Oil<\/strong><br\/>Oiling and massaging your scalp is a known Ayurvedic method of ensuring good blood flow throughout the scalp, whilst making sure the nutrients in the oil are deeply absorbed. Balance Ayurveda’s hair care products feature a nourishing hair oil made using Bhringraj, and a blend of 19 premium oils, that restores the health and lusciousness of your hair, while also minimizing hair fall. Highly beneficial in combating Pitta-imbalance-induced hair fall, a regular oil massage done twice a week can help properly nourish your hair follicles which help fight daily damage and inhibit hair loss. <\/p><p>After applying the oil across your scalp, massage with gentle pressure for about 15 minutes, keep for 2-3 hours, and wash off with a gentle, shampoo.<\/p><p><strong>The Magic of Potent, Organic Ingredients<\/strong><br\/>Keeping with the tradition of Ayurvedic medicine, we at Balance Ayurveda only source the best and most natural ingredients for all three of our hair growth products. To give you an insight into the enchanting gifts of nature we use in concocting magical hair care products, here are some of the best ingredients we use to nourish your hair.<\/p><p><strong>1. Bhringraj:<\/strong> Commonly nicknamed ‘Kesharaj’, which means “Ruler of the hair”. Bhringraj is tremendously rich in proteins, vitamins, and antioxidants which help promote hair growth while providing nourishment to the scalp. Thanks to its regenerative properties, Bhringraj also helps makes hair darker, thus combatting greying.<\/p><p><strong>2. Brahmi:<\/strong> Used for nearly 3000 years by Ayurvedic medical professionals, Brahmi with its abundant alkaloids activates the proteins responsible for hair growth. Rich in antioxidants, Brahmi nourishes your scalp, making it a lot healthier.<\/p><p><strong>3. Rosemary:<\/strong> A herb that offers the best hair fall solution, Rosemary helps deep clean the scalp, ridding it of any impurities as well as infections. Strengthening circulation, Rosemary prevents hair follicles from being starved of blood supply, dying off, and leading to hair loss.<\/p><p><strong>4. Ashwagandha:<\/strong> Proven to reduce cortisol levels in the body, ashwagandha reverses premature greying, controls scalp irritation, and promotes hair growth. One of the most potent Ayurvedic medicines, Ashwagandha, helps calm Kapha and Vata doshas, which in turn helps prevent hair loss.<\/p>","morecontent":"<p>Hairfall Among Women: The number one reason why women may be left hunting for the best hair care products is because of the hair fall that comes with their genes.
